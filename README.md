# Welcome to the move-from-localhost wiki!
Move From LocalHost helps developers to move their e-commerce WordPress website from their localhost directory to online hosting.
If you are a non English speaker developer and want to import the csv woocomerce data to your new website, you may need to change the address foe all of the uploaded images and videos.
(Read the wiki for more description on the project)

# How to use?
All you need to do is to install python, open the "move.py" file and replace the related field with your csv file's path. Then you define the problematic phrase and the replacement.
Run the script and let it do it's work. There you go! Your "new.csv" file is ready and all your non English data is still fine!
